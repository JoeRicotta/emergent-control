# emergent-control
A repository for updated analytical techniques in motor control 'nihil-deus-ex-machina'.

Goals of the repository include gathering shared code for:
  1. Uncontrolled Manifold Analysis (Scholz and Sch√∂ner 1999);
  2. Referent coordinate and apparent stiffness calculations of perturbed fingers (Ambike et al. 2016)
  3. Any other common analytical techniques used to study "control without control"
